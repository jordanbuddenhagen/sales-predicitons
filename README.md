# Outlet Sales Prediction Model 
##  General Informatoin
- Finding the distribution of sales items. 
- What type of outlet has the most sales?
- A prediction model for our model.
## Technologies used
- pyhton 3
- pandas in python
- sklearn in python
- seaborn in python

## Methods
- First part was to clean the selected data
- After cleaning, getting rid of unncessary data. 
- Main goal is to focus on Item Outlet Sale and compare it to other data. 
- Create a Decision Tree Regression to find the best prediciton model to Item Outlet Sales

- What Supermarket type has the most Sales.  
## Model
- what is most efficient prediction model be in Item Outlet Sales? 
- For the data, put the data through two different prediciton models.
- When tuning the Decision Tree Regressor, it gave the best results for a prediction model 
- The Mean Squared average was 738.77:  That result is under $1000 error and best correlates with the data we are trying to find. 

## Project status
- In Progress
## Recommendations 
- more explanatory graphs
